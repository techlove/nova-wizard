# License summary
Anyone can use and modify this package in any way they want, including commercially, as long as the commercial use is a) creating implemented wizards and/or b) using the implemented wizards.

Basically, the only condition is that you can't sublicense the package or embed it in a framework unless you do so under the AGPLv3 license (which is incompatible with the Nova framework). More details [below](#license).

# Installation

1. Add the package to your project;
    ```sh
    composer require wdelfuego/nova-wizard
    ```

1. Publish the config file;
    ```sh
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Wdelfuego\NovaWizard\ToolServiceProvider" --tag="config"
    ```

1. Update the config file (in `config/nova-wizard.php`);

    The config file allows you to specify as many wizards as you want, each under their own key.

	- Update the class name to whatever class name you want to use for this wizard (we will create the class later)
    - Update the uri under which the wizard will be available to your end users
    - Optionally, update the window title for this wizard

    Here's an example minimal config for an `AddUserWizard`:

    ```php
    use App\Nova\Wizards\AddUserWizard;

    return [
        'add-user' => [
            'class' => AddUserWizard::class,
            'uri' => 'wizard/add-user',
            'windowTitle' => 'Add user'
        ]
    ];
    ```

	The key used for each entry in the config file is the 'wizard key' (here: `add-user`) and will be required to add the wizard views to your `NovaServiceProvider`.

1. Update your `NovaServiceProvider`;
	- Add the following statement to the top of the file:

		`use Wdelfuego\NovaWizard\NovaWizard;`

	- Add the wizard tool to the array returned by the `tools()` method, supplying the wizard key to its constructor:

		```php
		public function tools()
		{
			return [
				new NovaWizard('add-user')
			];
		}
		```

	- If you manually specify your application menu in the `boot()` method, add a `MenuSection` or `MenuItem` that links to this wizard.

        Specify the wizard key so the correct URL can be generated, like this:

		```php
		MenuItem::link('Add a user', NovaWizard::pathToWizard('add-user'))
		```


1. Finally, implement the wizard;
	- Create the class file for your wizard. It can go wherever you want, but `/app/Nova/Wizards` is a good default location if you have no preference.
    - Make sure you correctly specify that class for the wizard in `config/nova-wizard.php`
    - Implement the class to extend `Wdelfuego\NovaWizard\AbstractWizard`.
    - You only need to implement the following three methods:
        - `wizardViewData() : array`  to define the steps and fields in your wizard, like this:
            ```php
            use Laravel\Nova\Fields;

			public function wizardViewData() : array {
                return [
                    'steps' => [
                        [
                            'title'  => 'Step 1/2',
                            'fields' => [
                                Fields\Text::make(__('Username'), 'username'),
                                Fields\Text::make(__('Text field'), 'myText'),
                                Fields\Textarea::make(__('Longer text'), 'myLongerText')
                                    ->help("You can use Help texts on Nova fields like you're used to"),
                                Fields\Number::make(__('Some number'), 'myNumber')
                                    ->rules('required')
                                    ->withMeta(['value' => 60])
                                    ->min(1)
                                    ->step(1),
                            ],
                        ],
                        [
                            'title'  => 'Step 2/2',
                            'fields' => [
                                Fields\Text::make(__('Text field 2'), 'myText2'),
                                Fields\Textarea::make(__('Longer text 2'), 'myLongerText2')
                                    ->help("You can use Help texts on Nova fields like you're used to"),
                                Fields\Number::make(__('Some number 2'), 'myNumber2')
                                    ->rules('required')
                                    ->withMeta(['value' => 60])
                                    ->min(1)
                                    ->step(1),
                            ],
                        ],
                    ],
                ];
			}
    		```

            

        - `onSubmit($formData, &$context) : bool` to specify what to do when valid wizard data is submitted, like this:
            ```php
			public function onSubmit($formData, &$context) : bool {
				//
				// When this method gets called, a valid and complete wizard was submitted.
				//
				// $formData is an array that contains the data submitted by the user.
				//
				// $context is an empty array that you can store arbitrary info in;
				// it will be passed to the next method so you can use it
				// to display specific context info to the user on success.
				
				// Parse submitted wizard data somehow
				$user = User::create(['name' => $formData['username']]);
				$context['newUserId'] = $user->id;

				// Return true at the end of this method to indicate success
				return true;

				// Or return false if the data can not be parsed successfully;
				// the user will then stay in the form view and have a chance
				// to revise the data before resubmitting.
			}
    		```

        - `successViewData($context) : array` to specify what message to show to the user when `onSubmit` returns true, like this:
            ```php
			public function successViewData($context) : array {
        
				return [
					'message' => 'Successfully created user with id: ' .$context['newUserId']
				];
			}
    		```

# Adding more wizards

Repeat step 3 to 5 from the Installation steps above for every wizard you want to add to your Laravel Nova app.

# Advanced usage

## Using query parameters

As of version 1.1, thanks to a contribution by @olliescase, you can pass query parameters to your wizard URL, that will then be available within the wizard definition so
you can customize your wizard or pre-fill certain fields based on the query parameter values.

For example, if you want to use a wizard to do something in the context of a specific Nova resource instance, you could create a Nova `Action` that returns a parametrized URL:

    return $this->redirect('/' . NovaWizard::pathToWizard('my-wizard') . "?parentId={$resource->id}");

Then in the wizard definition you can get the specified parameter value like this:

    $this->request->get('parentId')


Or, if you want to use the same wizard definition for two slightly different forms, you could add it to the application menu twice, but differentiate using a query parameter.
You can then get the value of that query parameter in the wizard definition using `$this->request->get('paramName')` so you can customize the wizard fields and how submissions are processed depending on the context.
